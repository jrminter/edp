## The jrmMsaPoster

John Minter's poster for the August 2013 Microscopy and
Microanalysis meeting.

**Note**

1. The scripts to build the poster assume that you have R
   installed along with the packages Peaks and EDP. For
   R $\ge$ 3.0.0, you need the patched version of Peaks from
   this repository.
2. These also assume that you have a working
   version of $\LaTeX$ installed (tested with texlive 2012) and
   in your path.
3. You also need and ghostscript installed and
   in your path (to compress the pdf). On windows,
   I copied ``gswin32c.exe`` to ``gs.exe`` to have the
   scripts work like the shell scripts.
